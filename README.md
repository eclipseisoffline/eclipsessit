# Eclipse's Sit Mod

This is a server-side focussed mod that adds commands as `/sit` and `/crawl`.
Attempts to port all features from [GSit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/gsit-modern-sit-seat-and-chair-lay-and-crawl-plugin-1-13-1-20-4.62325/) over.

## License

This mod is licensed under GNU GPLv3.

## Credits

This mod is heavily inspired by the GSit plugin for Bukkit-based servers, and attempts to port all features over.

## Usage

This mod is still very much in development, but beta builds for Minecraft 1.20.4 can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipseisoffline/eclipsessit/packages/2059742).
This mod requires the Fabric API.
The mod can be used both on the client and on dedicated servers.
